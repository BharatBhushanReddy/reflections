Q) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A) i would like to use a remote repository when i will be working as a team where each person on team gets to share their work with others.

Q) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A) if we want a programme to work like we want and if we dont like a particular feature, then we can avoid pulling that branch. We will not have this comfort if git automatically does it for us.

Q) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A) fork : It is similar to clone but it makes a copy of a repository on our github account instead of cloning it to our computer.
   clone : It makes a copy of repository on our local computer from github.
   branches : they make copy of current working branch on our computer itself.
